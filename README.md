# The Game
A simple Anagrams game! Users will form as many words as they can from a randomly selected set of letters within a time limit.
Users can select 30s, 45s or 60s rounds with 6, 7, 8 or 9 letters, and can choose from 3 different game modes. A running log 
is available in each game, tracking what words have been submitted, and the points earnt from them.

## Normal Mode
This mode offers the classic game; form as many words as you can from the given letters, without repetition. The selection of letters
may contain duplicates.

## Extended Mode
This mode allows repetition; players can form longer words that yield more points, and thereby reach higher scores. The letters are guaranteed to be distinct.

## Chaos Mode
Like Extended Mode, this mode allows repetition and guarantees a distinct set of letters. However, the selection of letters will change after every valid submission.

# Project Description
A simple static website project through which I developed my front-end coding skills. This project is wholly composed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Credits
The [English dictionary](src/words.json) used for this game was obtained from [dwyl's GitHub](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words), and slightly
altered to remove ethnic slurs.

Online resources, such as StackOverflow and w3schools, assisted in my programming and debugging of this project.
